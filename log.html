My thinking is that I can build a program to add this info from the command line and automate it, but who knows! I'm also adding typing speed tracking to my stats!</td>

Not sure but pursuing it for now I think.</td>

I have an A-Level in Maths and Further Maths so have covered some statistics but more in theory than actually working with large data sets.</td>
