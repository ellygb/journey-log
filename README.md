I really don't think that's sustainable so have created this repo where I can add a little note rather than writing a whole post. My thinking is that I can build a program to add this info from the command line and automate it, but who knows! I'm also adding typing speed tracking to my stats!</td>

Initially didn't want to go down this route as I didn't think I wanted to do web development but I am actually enjoying it and it could be very useful in my current job, which would maybe give me an ability to learn as part of my job. Not sure but pursuing it for now I think.</td>

If I want to pursue this more I think I will need to take a step back and do some statistics courses to refresh my knowledge! I have an A-Level in Maths and Further Maths so have covered some statistics but more in theory than actually working with large data sets.</td>

I'm not done with it so will revisit but was surprised how much I enjoyed it. And good to be able to use some new skills in my day job! I was capable of writing CSS and HTML before but I don't think I would have been able to do anything so complex or follow the articles about the different requirements for different email clients.</td>

I'm maybe considering data science as a route as I have always been a pretty big maths nerd but it may be well over my head. I'm going to start with Harvard's CS50 and see where it takes me!</td>
